### 3 Agents + Figma MCP | Updated February 2026

---

## The Complete Pipeline

```
Your Idea
    ↓
Agent 1 — PRD Agent
    ↓ PRD document (user stories, personas, features, success metrics)
Agent 3 — Screen Architecture & Governance Agent
    ↓ Screen inventory + user flow map + Figma file plan + governance doc
Agent 2 — Design System Agent
    ↓ Design system spec + tokens.json (W3C DTCG) + README.md
Figma — Design (fully structured, token-ready, governed)
    ↓
Figma MCP + Claude — React Native + Tailwind code
```

## The 3 Agents

| Agent | Input | Outputs | Set up in |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Agent 1 — PRD** | Your rough idea | PRD document | Claude Project 1 |
| **Agent 3 — Screen Architecture** | PRD from Agent 1 | Screen inventory, flow map, Figma file plan, governance doc | Claude Project 3 |
| **Agent 2 — Design System** | PRD from Agent 1 | Design system spec, tokens.json, README | Claude Project 2 |

*Run Agent 3 before Agent 2 — the screen inventory informs which components the design system needs to prioritize.*

---

## How to Set Up Each Agent

1. Go to **claude.ai → Projects → New Project**
2. Name it (e.g. `PRD Agent`, `Screen Architecture Agent`, `Design System Agent`)
3. Click **"Project Instructions"** → paste the full contents of the agent's `.md` file
4. Every new conversation in that project behaves as that agent

## Handoff Flow

### Agent 1 → Agent 3
```
## Handoff from PRD Agent
[paste full PRD]

## Project Context
- Platforms: [Mobile / Web / Both]
- Design tool: Figma (free seat + Figma MCP)
- Stack: React Native + Tailwind
- Type: [Open source / Portfolio / Client]

Let's map the architecture.
```

### Agent 1 → Agent 2 (after Agent 3)
```
## Handoff from PRD Agent
[paste full PRD]

## Screen Architecture Summary (from Agent 3)
[paste component dependencies list from screen inventory]

## Project Context
- Platforms: [Mobile / Web / Both]
- Design tool: Figma (free seat + Figma MCP)
- Stack: React Native + Tailwind
- Type: [Open source / Portfolio / Client]

Let's design the system.
```

## What Each Agent Produces

### Agent 1 — PRD
- Executive summary
- Problem statement
- Goals & success metrics
- User personas
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Feature requirements (MVP vs Phase 2)
- Technical constraints
- Competitive landscape
- Open questions & risks

### Agent 3 — Screen Architecture & Governance
- **Screen inventory** — every screen with ID, states, component deps, MVP flag, status tag
- **User flow map** — Mermaid.js diagram (paste into FigJam directly)
- **Figma file architecture** — exact page/frame structure for free seat (2 files, 3 pages each)
- **Governance document** — component health statuses, versioning, decision log, monthly ritual, GitHub structure

### Agent 2 — Design System
- **Design system spec** — principles, color system with WCAG 2.2 AA ratios, typography, spacing, radius, shadows, icons, motion, accessibility, component library
- **tokens.json** — W3C DTCG 2025.10 standard, imports directly into Figma via Tokens Studio (free plugin)
- **README.md** — plain-language guide for designers and developers

## Figma MCP Workflow (After All 3 Agents)

Once your Figma files are set up using Agent 3's architecture plan and Agent 2's token system:

| Task | What to do |
|---|---|
| Inspect a Figma frame | Share URL → Claude reads nodes, layout, tokens |
| Generate component code | Share frame URL → Claude outputs React Native + Tailwind |
| Check design vs spec | Share URL → Claude compares against design system |
| Verify token usage | Share URL → Claude reads Figma variables and checks consistency |

**Example prompt:**
> "Here's my Figma frame for the Home screen: [URL]. The design system spec is in this conversation. Generate a React Native + Tailwind component for the DepartureBoardRow in the populated state."

## Files in This Pack

| File | What it is |
|---|---|

| `agent-3-screen-architecture.md` | Agent 3 system prompt — paste into Claude Project Instructions |
| `agent-2-design-system.md` | Agent 2 system prompt — paste into Claude Project Instructions |
| `master-guide.md` | This file |

## Recommended Future Agents (When Ready)

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 🖥 Figma-to-Code Agent | Dedicated agent with design system context always loaded, optimized for Figma MCP → React Native |
| ✅ QA & Design Review Agent | Checks screens against PRD requirements, design system rules, and WCAG 2.2 AA |
| 📦 Handoff & Release Agent | Generates developer handoff docs, release notes, and changelogs per sprint |
